		Berry Creek Outdoors is my hunting and everything outdoors blog.
	</p>
	<p>
		I never grew up hunting, nor had anyone in my social circle for that matter. But I always felt a calling that came from deep within my soul. A yearning for a connection with the ones that came before me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, as an adult, I had the means and time to become an adult onset hunter. As an adult onset hunter or any hunter, young or old, one has a unique connection to the great outdoors and the hunting tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation. For many, it is also a way to reconnect with nature and understand the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

		For me, hunting is not just about the thrill of the hunt, but about the comradery that comes with it and yes, the food. I understand the importance of fresh, organic food and the benefits of knowing where your food comes from. Hunting provides me with a sense of self-sufficiency and an appreciation for the process of obtaining food. Nothing tastes better than freshly harevested meat or fish.

		At the end of the day, hunting, fishing, camping and hiking is an excuse to play in the Lord's bounty.
